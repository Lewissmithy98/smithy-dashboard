# Smithy's Home Assistant Dashboard

This is my custom Home Assistant dashboard setup, designed for a clean, modern wall panel display.

### Features:
- Fully responsive UI for tablets and laptops
- Dynamic popups for room controls
- Custom lighting controls (lights-on counters, room light toggles)
- Integrated UK holidays calendar
- Optimised for Fully Kiosk Browser wall panels
- Custom icons and themes

### How to Use
- Feel free to copy any YAML you find useful!
- You might need the following custom cards installed via HACS:
  - `button-card`
  - `browser_mod`
  - `calendar-card-pro`
  - `layout-card`
  - `card-mod`
  - `bubble-card` (optional)
  
### Notes
- Designed to work best on a Fire HD10 tablet (using Fully Kiosk Browser)
- Using a custom minimalist theme
- All popups designed with responsiveness in mind
